Configuration
-------------

.. contents::
  :local:

Drivers
~~~~~~~

See "Drivers" section for :ref:`debugging_tool_ftdi` debug probe.

Running modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GAPuino supports 2 main modes:

1. Running from RAM, ``boot_mode=jtag``
2. Running from HyperFlash, ``boot_mode=jtag_hyper``

A running process can be controlled through the internal upload commands:

* ``load``, Load loads a binary into RAM.
* ``reqloop``, Reqloop implements workstation proxies for file access and more
* ``ioloop``, Ioloop enables printf via the debug bridge
* ``start``, Start starts execution of the binary on GAP8
* ``wait``, Wait keeps the bridge active until the program terminates

You can configure "boot mode" and list of upload commands using :ref:`projectconf`.
Default values are:

* ``board_upload.boot_mode = jtag``
* ``board_upload.commands = load reqloop ioloop start wait``

Run from RAM
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a default behavior when you run "Upload" task in :ref:`pioide` or use
:ref:`piocore` and :option:`platformio run --target` command with ``upload`` target.

Run from RAM (without any bridge interaction)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Configure build environment using :ref:`projectconf` as described below

  .. code-block:: ini

    [env:gapuino]
    platform = riscv_gap
    board = gapuino
    framework = ...
    board_upload.commands = load start

* Run "Upload" task in :ref:`pioide` or use :ref:`piocore` and
  :option:`platformio run --target` command with ``upload`` target.

Flash and run from RAM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The same as :ref:`platform_riscv_gap_uploadfs`.

Flash and run from Flash
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Configure build environment using :ref:`projectconf` as described below

  .. code-block:: ini

    [env:gapuino]
    platform = riscv_gap
    board = gapuino
    framework = ...
    board_upload.boot_mode = jtag_hyper
    board_upload.commands = reqloop ioloop start wait

* Perform :ref:`platform_riscv_gap_uploadfs`.

Run from Flash
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
  You have to perform :ref:`platform_riscv_gap_uploadfs` before.

* Configure build environment using :ref:`projectconf` as described below

  .. code-block:: ini

    [env:gapuino]
    platform = riscv_gap
    board = gapuino
    framework = ...
    board_upload.boot_mode = jtag_hyper
    board_upload.commands = reqloop ioloop start wait

* Run "Upload" task in :ref:`pioide` or use :ref:`piocore` and
  :option:`platformio run --target` command with ``upload`` target.

Run from Flash (without any bridge interaction)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
  You have to perform :ref:`platform_riscv_gap_uploadfs` before.

  .. code-block:: ini

    platform = riscv_gap
    board = gapuino
    framework = ...
    board_upload.boot_mode = jtag_hyper
    board_upload.commands = start

* Run "Upload" task in :ref:`pioide` or use :ref:`piocore` and
  :option:`platformio run --target` command with ``upload`` target.

.. _platform_riscv_gap_uploadfs:

Uploading files to HyperFlash
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Create new project using :ref:`pioide` or initialize project using
   :ref:`piocore` and :ref:`cmd_init` (if you have not initialized it yet)
2. Create ``data`` folder (it should be on the same level as ``src`` folder)
   and put files here. Also, you can specify own location for
   :ref:`projectconf_pio_data_dir`
3. Run "Upload File System image" task in :ref:`pioide` or use :ref:`piocore`
   and :option:`platformio run --target` command with ``uploadfs`` target.

Examples:

* `PULP OS File System <https://github.com/pioplus/platform-riscv_gap/tree/develop/examples/gapuino-pulp-os-filesystem>`_
